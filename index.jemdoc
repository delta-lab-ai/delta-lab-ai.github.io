== Research Overview



1. We *integrate AI methods with physics knowledge*.

a) We build LLMs for autoformalization, program synthesis, and reasoning on PDE problems \[[https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00963 _1_], [https://www.leanfinder.org/ _2_]].

b) We introduce physics into data-driven fluids modeling and reconstruction \[[https://hybridmpm.github.io/ _3_], [https://autumnyq.github.io/WildSmoke/ _4_], [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13897 _5_], [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15734 _6_]].

2. We develop *principled deep learning methods*
\[[https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=304639&org=CISE _7_], [https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11535 _8_], [https://openreview.net/forum?id=H94a1_Pyr-6 _9_], [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05662 _10_]]
inspired by deep learning theory.

3. We are broadly interested in LLM \[[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12281 _11_], [https://openreview.net/forum?id=6mLjDwYte5 _12_], [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04472 _13_]],
computer vision \[[https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07448 _14_], [https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09747 _15_]],
model efficiency \[[https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3510835 _16_], [https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08198 _17_]],
self-supervised learning \[[https://openreview.net/forum?id=F8whUO8HNbP _18_], [https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06965 _19_]],
automated machine learning (AutoML) \[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10917 _20_]],
etc.
