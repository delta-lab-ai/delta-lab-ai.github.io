== Research Overview

At the core, we develop *principled deep learning methods*
([https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=304639&org=CISE _1_], [https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11535 _2_], [https://openreview.net/forum?id=H94a1_Pyr-6 _3_], [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05662 _4_]),
inspired by deep learning theory;
and we address *scientific problems*, including scientific machine learning ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15734 _5_])
and bioinformatics ([https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.17.24304438v1.full.pdf _6_]).

We are also interested in a broad range of topics, including: 
LLM ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12281 _7_], [https://openreview.net/forum?id=6mLjDwYte5 _8_]),
computer vision  ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07448 _9_], [https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09747 _10_]),
model efficiency ([https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3510835 _11_], [https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08198 _12_]),
self-supervised learning ([https://openreview.net/forum?id=F8whUO8HNbP _13_], [https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06965 _14_]),
automated machine learning (AutoML) ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10917 _15_]),
etc.
